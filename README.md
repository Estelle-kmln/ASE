## Project Documentation

"The Battle Cards microservices project uses an Nginx API Gateway on port 8080 for all service access. All services (auth, card, game, leaderboard) are accessed through the gateway at http://localhost:8080/api/*. The project includes comprehensive testing with pytest (45+ unit tests), Postman/Newman (50 API endpoint tests), and Locust performance tests. All tests are automated via GitHub Actions with 3 parallel test jobs. Complete documentation is available in the documentation/ folder."
