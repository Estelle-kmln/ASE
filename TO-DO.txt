1. Personal Data Encryption at Rest
- Encrypt all information stored for a user

2. Enhanced Session Security
- Add session timeout tracking 
- Implement token refresh mechanism
- Implement concurrent session detection/prevention

3. Account Security Features
- Account lockout after failed login attempts
- Password strength enforcement (currently minimal) => add special characters and increase minimal length

4 Data Access Control
- Ensure users can only access their own data
- Audit trail for data access
- Data deletion/anonymization capabilities (GDPR compliance)

5. Database Connection Security
- SSL/TLS for database connections
- Database credential encryption
- Connection pooling with security

## Recommended Implementation Priority 🎯
Since your task focuses on account data safety, I recommend focusing on:

1. Add account lockout mechanism (prevents brute force attacks)

2. Enhance password requirements (enforce stronger passwords)

3. Implement password change history (prevent reuse)

4. Add additional PII encryption (if you collect email, phone, etc.)

5. Enhanced session management (token refresh, concurrent session control)
