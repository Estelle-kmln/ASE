## Recommended Implementation Priority 🎯
Since your task focuses on account data safety, I recommend focusing on:

2. Enhance password requirements (enforce stronger passwords)

3. Implement password change history (prevent reuse)

5. Enhanced session management (token refresh, concurrent session control)
